Below, we outline what this method is, the different ways it works as well as key considerations when using this approach to value a company.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is valuation using multiples? <strong>Valuations using multiples is one of the three main approaches to valuing a business, sometimes referred to as the \u2018market-based approach\u2019. The method assumes that similar companies (or assets) should be valued similarly, so it uses financial data from other companies to help determine a company\u2019s value. A financial ratio (or \u2018multiple\u2019) observed from these peer companies is applied to the company that is being valued. By applying this multiple from similar companies, the value of the new company is estimated. This is a simple and practical method widely used by valuation practitioners. The challenging aspect is finding the appropriate comparison company multiples to use.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First we provide a quick overview of key takeaway points, then we explain step-by-step how the method works.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">QUICK OVERVIEW<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Valuation using multiples is one of the three main ways to value a business, sometimes referred to as the &#8216;market-based approach&#8217;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s used widely by valuation practitioners, who will take a ratio either from comparable companies, or comparable transactions, to help value their target company<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is often divided into two main approaches &#8211; Comparable Company Analysis (CCA) and Comparable Transaction Analysis (CTA)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CCA compares using companies, whereas CTA uses transactions<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ratio used might be EV\/EBITDA, EV\/Sales, P\/E or another, depending on the valuation performed and the type of business being valued<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ratio is then used in a simple multiplication calculation, to determine the value of the company in question<\/span><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The multiple being used is taken either from a company whose price is listed on a public exchange, or from an M&amp;A transaction where the comparable company was the target of an acquisition<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These multiples\/ratios can be time-consuming to find, and the selection of correct peer companies or appropriate transactions can have a large impact on the final valuation result<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Practitioners will often search online or subscribe to a database in order to access these multiples<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Valutico is one software platform where it&#8217;s possible to access these multiples <\/span>(<a href=\"\/book-a-demo\/\">book a demo to learn more<\/a>)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Major Assumptions of the Multiples Approach<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This method assumes that one good way to value a company is to compare it with the value of similar companies. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The major assumptions being that similar assets &#8211; or companies &#8211; will sell at similar prices, and that it is valid to make such a comparison between companies.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The method relies on using a financial metric known as a &#8216;multiple&#8217; (a ratio), as a comparison point. So another major assumption when adopting this method, is that the type of ratio chosen as the comparison point, <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">such as P\/E or EV\/EBITDA should be similar across similar firms.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Two Different Methods of Valuation Using Multiples<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Broadly, there are two different common ways to value using multiples.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first is <em>comparable company analysis<\/em> (CCA), also known as \u201ccomps\u201d. <\/span>The second is precedent transaction analysis, known as \u201cprecedents\u201d and also called a <em>comparable transaction analysis<\/em> (CTA).<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To conduct a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">comparable company analysis,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a company is compared with its peers on the basis of these aforementioned multiples. The data for these multiples can be taken from publicly available sources as all of these measures can be calculated from the financial reports of the publicly traded companies.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, it is more difficult to conduct a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">precedent transaction analysis<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as there is not much public data available for past transactions. However, to conduct such an analysis you have to search for transactions with similar businesses like the one you are analyzing. After that one can apply the above mentioned multiples to the target company.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Pros<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can be used for a quick estimation of a company&#8217;s value<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simple approach to value a company.

This EBITDA multiple is the EV\/EBITDA ratio. From this we determine the Enterprise Value of the business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>The Underlying Logic of Valuation Using Multiples<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The core way the approach works is to look at the financial performance of other <a href=\"https:\/\/valutico.com\/peer-selection-guidebook\/\">similar companies<\/a>, but not actually compare directly with say the main metric like sales, or EBITDA, but use the \u2018ratio\u2019 from those figures as the comparison point.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is assumed that similar companies should be able to apply these ratios from one to another and return a valid valuation estimate, because they are similar enough in operations and business environment that it would be valid to do so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Partly because this approach is simple and therefore practical, it is widely used by <a href=\"https:\/\/valutico.com\/peer-selection-guidebook\/\">valuation practitioners<\/a>. The challenging aspect is simply finding the correct comparison company multiples to use.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Choosing the Multiple<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Multiples are taken from a range of different financial metrics, like EV\/Sales or EV\/EBITDA, and then applied to that related metric (e.g. Sales, or EBITDA) of the company you\u2019re valuing by multiplication as shown above.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, in the case of using EV\/EBITDA, you would need to know the (median) EV\/EBITDA multiple from <a href=\"https:\/\/valutico.com\/peer-selection-guidebook\/\">similar companies, or the industry<\/a>. In this simple example, you take that multiple (ratio) and then multiply it by your company\u2019s EBITDA, to give you the EV or Enterprise Value.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Trading, Transaction and Experience Multiples<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Broadly speaking, valuation multiples are used in two different methodologies as explained above, either in a <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">trading <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">comparable analysis (i.e. observed from companies listed on the stock exchange), or a <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">transaction <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">comparable analysis (i.e. observed from M&amp;A deals).

The higher up in the P&amp;L statement the metric is that is selected, the more assumptions are made on the similarity of operations of the respective companies.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if we use the EV\/Sales multiple (with Sales being the first item on the P&amp;L), we disregard the operating (profit margins), capital (debt and interest) and asset structures (depreciation &amp; amortization) of the companies. This is useful if we have limited information or are comfortable that the companies operate on a similar basis, but may become problematic if there are material differences in the way the companies operate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, if we use the P\/E multiple (with Earnings being the last line item on the P&amp;L), we have already taken the operating, capital and asset structures of the respective companies into consideration. We are thus comparing the prices per each unit of actual earnings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note that, because the impact of debt (in the form of interest), falls below EBIT on the P&amp;L, typically any metric below that would be an equity metric and any metric above that would be an enterprise metric. This is because Enterprise Value consists of Debt + Equity but Equity Value only consists of Equity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Common Types of Enterprise Valuation Multiples<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some common enterprise valuation multiples:<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>EV\/Sales<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 This is the ratio of Enterprise Value to the sales of a company.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>EV\/EBITDA<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; Shows the ratio of Enterprise Value to the EBITDA of a company.

For example, if I use the P\/E multiple, I should use the Earnings of the comparable companies for the same year (say 2021) as for my target company.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Typically, one would initially use the last actual year as that is based on facts with no assumptions or estimates. One can, however, also conduct valuation exercises for several years for each multiple, i.e. using an EV\/EBITDA approach for 2021, 2022 and 2023 (provided we have forecast EBITDA figures for our comparable companies and our target company).<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Comparisons Are Often Using Companies in the Same Industry<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Usually, it is very important to only <a href=\"https:\/\/valutico.com\/peer-selection-guidebook\/\">compare companies from the same industry<\/a> when conducting a valuation with multiples. The main reason is that trading multiples are different in various industries because of various factors that might be specific to an industry, such as market size, market growth, capital intensity, leverage, etc. It is therefore common to see industry-specific statements such as \u201cUS tech firms are trading at 20x earnings\u201d, or \u201cConstruction companies are trading at 2x book value.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Valuation with EBITDA multiples<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Valuation with EBITDA multiples is often chosen because it disregards the effects of differences between companies\u2019 debt costs (interest), taxes and depreciation &amp; amortization on the valuation. As these are excluded from the valuation, the approach assumes that these comparable companies have similar operating characteristics (such as sales growth, margins and return metrics).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Valuation Using Multiples \u2013 What Is It and How Does [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":15673,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"om_disable_all_campaigns":false,"inline_featured_image":false},"categories":[110,37,35],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.7 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Valuation Using Multiples\u2014What Is It and How Does It Work?
