This is because otherwise, logically, as the company grows it will eventually grow bigger than the entire economy of its country, which obviously doesn\u2019t make much sense.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So there\u2019s a narrow margin within which your perpetual growth rate lies and makes sense, but small differences can have a big impact.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rationale for using the long-term inflation target is that it assumes that the business has reached such a mature state that it is no longer increasing market share or expanding in any other way, but simply increasing sales prices (and free cash flow) in line with all other prices in the economy (i.e. inflation). <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the UK, for example, the long-term inflation target is 2% whereas for South Africa it is 5%.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can find the long term inflation rate on websites like <a href=\"http:\/\/Tradingeconomics.com\">TradingEconomics.com<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3.

But this is often a mistake, and something that you should watch out for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s a mistake because you can end up with outliers\u2014transactions that are not a good fit for your company, as a comparison point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basically, you want to focus on the quality of your comparable transactions, rather than the quantity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s far better to have one or two really appropriate transactions, than 15 or 20 transactions that aren\u2019t that relevant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing that signals that a transaction is not an appropriate comparison is when a very small percentage was acquired. This typically happens as a follow up to an earlier transaction or in case of an investment rather than an acquisition. Transaction multiples are most useful for transactions involving a controlling stake being acquired (i.e. at least 50%) as that is typical of a private transaction.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.
